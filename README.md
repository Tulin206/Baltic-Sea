**Task:** 
Predicting Baltic Sea Temperature and Salinity
Two years of temperature and salinity data are provided from the Baltic Sea, sampled every 6 hours (one year for training, one year for testing). The data is both temporal and spatial.

**Objective:**
Improve predictions over these naive baselines (Persistence model, Linear regression model) using machine learning/deep learning (LSTM+CNN).
